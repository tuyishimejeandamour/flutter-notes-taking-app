## Video Script & Presentation Flow

### Introduction (30 seconds)
**[Show your face on camera]**

> "Hello, I'm [Your Name]. Today I'll demonstrate my Flutter Notes app built with Firebase, showcasing clean architecture with BLoC state management, full CRUD operations, and real-time Firestore synchronization. Let's begin with a cold start."

### 1. Cold Start Demonstration (30 seconds)

**Narration:**
> "The app initializes Firebase and shows our clean authentication interface with Material Design 3 styling."

### 2. Sign-Up Process (1 minute)
**[Focus on authentication screen]**

> "First, I'll create a new user account to demonstrate our validation system."

**Actions:**
1. Tap "Don't have an account? Sign Up"
2. **Show validation errors:**
   - Enter invalid email: `invalid-email` → Show error
   - Enter weak password: `123` → Show validation message
   - Leave fields empty → Show required field errors

**Narration:**
> "Notice the comprehensive input validation - invalid email formats, weak passwords, and empty fields all show specific error messages through our custom SnackBar system."

3. **Successful sign-up:**
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `Test123!`
   - Tap "Sign Up"
   - Show loading indicator

**Narration:**

### 3. Empty State Display (30 seconds)
**[App navigates to notes screen]**

**Actions:**
- App automatically navigates to notes screen
- Show centered empty state message

**Narration:**
> "Perfect! After successful authentication, we see the empty state with our hint text: 'Nothing here yet—tap ➕ to add a note.' This confirms the authentication flow works seamlessly."

### 4. Firebase Console - Authentication (30 seconds)
**[Split screen or switch to browser]**

**Actions:**
- Open Firebase Console
- Navigate to Authentication tab
- Show the newly created user

**Narration:**
> "In the Firebase console, we can see our user was successfully created in Firebase Authentication with the email we just used."

### 5. Create Notes (1.5 minutes)
**[Return to app screen]**

   - Enter: "My first note about Flutter development"
   - Tap "Save"
   - Show success SnackBar with green color and check icon

2. **Second note:**
   - Tap ➕ again
   - Enter: "BLoC pattern makes state management clean and predictable"

- Navigate to Firestore Database
- Show the notes collection structure: `users/{uid}/notes/{noteId}`
- Point out the data fields: text, userId, createdAt, updatedAt
- Show the real-time timestamps

**Narration:**
> "In Firestore, our notes are stored with proper user isolation. Each user has their own subcollection, and every note includes timestamps for created and updated times. This demonstrates our clean data architecture."

### 7. Read & Update Operations (1 minute)
**[Return to app]**

**Actions:**
1. **Show notes list:**
   - Scroll through notes
   - Point out Card design with shadows
   - Show timestamp formatting

5. Try again, tap "Delete"
6. Show deletion success SnackBar
7. Note disappears from list

**Narration:**
> "Deletion requires confirmation to prevent accidents. Our AlertDialog provides clear options, and successful deletion shows appropriate feedback before removing the item from the list."

### 10. Rotation Test (30 seconds)
**[Rotate device/emulator]**

**Actions:**
- Rotate to landscape mode
